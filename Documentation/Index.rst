What does it do?
----------------
It's modify the Backend-view. I think the best view is a small view and not the largest icons in T3.
This modification reduce the icon and allow to modifiy some css stlyes in backend.
Also i use a small jquery script to reduce the content in the previewfields.

- smaller Icons (reduce to: 32x32px > 20x20px;)

- javascript to crop long texte (maxLength = 250)

- save-icons not in dropdown, Icons next to each other (faster to save, save and new, save and close)


Custom-Modification
-------------------

- With this extension you can write in the page a custom-class field
>> See: _sample/page_class.ts

- Also you can add a special SEO-Title if you want
>> See: _sample/page_title.ts



Screenshots
-----------

- Smaller Icons in the sidebar with navigation to saving space
